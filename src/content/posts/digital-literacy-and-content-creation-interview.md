<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Building creative confidence through digital literacy</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">As an Adobe Creative Campus, RMIT empowers students to build creative confidence with support from Adobe Hub Coaches and hands-on access to Adobe tools.</h3>



<p>RMIT is one of only nine universities globally recognised as an Adobe Creative Campus Innovator, setting a benchmark for how students engage with digital tools.  <br>The recognition reflects inclusive programs that foster creative confidence, career readiness and standout portfolios. <br>One example is the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/library/adobe/coaches">Adobe Hub Coaches:</a> RMIT students who can support you with advice and resources across Adobe Creative Cloud products. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Adobe Hub Coach Matteo Curcio shares his perspective on digital literacy and how tools like Adobe Express are helping students build skills that matter.</h3>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What digital literacy means to students</h4>



<p>Digital literacy is about more than knowing how to use software. It’s about using technology to express ideas, solve problems and communicate effectively. Matteo describes it as “…the confidence to use digital tools to create, communicate and solve problems in ways that matter to you”.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How Adobe Express supports creative growth</h4>



<p>Adobe Express offers intuitive and easy to learn design, video and web creation that has seen students produce animated videos, interactive presentations and one-page websites. &nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>It gives you everything you need to create professional-looking projects quickly, even if you’ve never designed before</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Matteo also highlights Adobe’s responsible approach to AI: “Every AI-generated asset is tagged with&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://contentcredentials.org/">Content Credentials</a>, and Adobe leads initiatives like the&nbsp;<a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/">Content Authenticity Initiative</a>&nbsp;so there’s transparency and trust in creative work.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Applying digital skills in study and work</h4>



<p>Adobe Express allows students to “collaborate and present ideas in ways that stand out. Instead of handing in static PowerPoints or plain documents, you can create one-page websites that feel like digital portfolios, animated videos that bring scientific research to life, or social campaigns that look like they came from a professional team,” Matteo says.</p>



<p>In the workplace, the same skills help students produce marketing materials, presentations and social media content quickly and with impact, giving a platform to “share ideas, promote events, or present projects with content that’s clear, professional, and easy to follow,” Matteo shares.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Support from Adobe Hub coaches</h4>



<p>Adobe Hub coaches help students get the most out of Adobe tools. That might mean finding a faster workflow, choosing the right app for a project or exploring new AI features.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If you’ve got an idea, we help you make it real, whether it’s for a class, a job application or something you’ve always wanted to create,” says Matteo.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Digital literacy in action</h4>



<p>Matteo has seen students go from complete beginners to producing work that looks professionally designed. Many start by experimenting with templates and AI tools. They then move on to building projects that feel polished and ready for a real audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They’ve built one-page websites to showcase assignments, animated explainer videos for group projects, posters for events, and full social media campaigns complete with scheduled posts,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most rewarding part, he adds, is watching students realise they can create professional content quickly without needing to master complex software first.&nbsp;</p>
