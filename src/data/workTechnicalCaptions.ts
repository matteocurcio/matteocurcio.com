export const WORK_TECHNICAL_CAPTIONS: Record<string, string> = {
  "moveactive": "High-energy sport work where the footage is already doing a lot - fast movement, mixed lighting, skin under stress. The job was to push contrast and saturation hard enough to feel punchy without letting skin go plastic or highlights clip into noise. I built a contrast curve with controlled roll-off at the top end, drove brand-critical hues selectively, and ran tight shot-to-shot balancing so continuity held through setups that were never going to match on their own.",
  "yamaha": "Yamaha wanted premium without synthetic. That sounds simple until you're trying to keep product whites truly neutral while everything around them is reflecting colour. The grade sat on clean micro-contrast and disciplined skin isolation, with highlight management doing the heavy lifting to keep detail in chrome and bodywork. Local keys where needed, but the goal was a confident commercial finish that didn't look like it was trying too hard.",
  "victorian-queens": "Cinematic character work with mood shifts built into the narrative. Softer toe contrast gave the shadows room to breathe, and I used selective colour separation in wardrobe and practical lights to let each setup carry its own atmosphere without breaking the overall visual language. Shadow density was the constant negotiation - expressive enough to feel authored, controlled enough that faces stayed readable in every scene.",
  "tradie": "Rugged, no-nonsense campaign where the product had to read clearly through dust, movement, and rapid editorial cuts. I leaned into a robust contrast structure with warm highlight bias and kept saturation honest - grounded, not stylised. The real work was matching across cameras and exposure swings so the pace of the edit felt deliberate rather than chaotic.",
  "madebox": "The brief was warmth and authenticity - handmade feel, trust-led branding. I built the palette around natural skin and wood tones, pulled back digital harshness with gentle highlight compression, and ran subtle secondary corrections to keep product colours consistent between interior and exterior. The kind of grade that's doing a lot of work precisely because it doesn't look like it.",
  "national-hero": "Emotional storytelling with national identity running through the visuals. Clean skin rendering was non-negotiable, and I pushed into richer greens and golds where the imagery supported it without turning the whole thing into a flag. Controlled contrast expansion gave it cinematic weight while keeping luminance broadcast-safe through fast editorial transitions - which is where most grades like this start falling apart.",
  "be-on-it-ent": "Contemporary, socially native, but still premium. Three things that fight each other if you're not careful. The grade was contrast-forward with vibrant but controlled chroma - enough pop to hold attention on a phone, enough restraint to not look cheap on a bigger screen. Selective keys on faces and hero props, and tight shot matching so the pace could stay sharp without the visuals drifting between setups.",
  "spring-party": "Politix needed fashion-forward polish - glossy highlights, premium colour separation, and wardrobe tones that stayed elegant under mixed practical lighting. I built a contrast response with shine to it, protected skin neutrality where the lighting wanted to push it warm or cool, and used targeted hue shaping so fabric colours held their identity across the full campaign. Fashion work where the grade has to serve the clothes without forgetting there's a person wearing them.",
  "refreshed": "Clean grooming aesthetics where skin has to look healthy, not retouched. I balanced cooler environmental values against warmer skin channels to create separation without obvious manipulation, controlled specular peaks so the product read clearly, and used selective density to build depth in the frame. The texture had to feel tactile - close enough to touch - without any of the harsh clinical quality that grooming content defaults to.",
  "kikkoman": "Food work where the line between appetising and oversaturated is about two nodes on a curve. I kept warm midtones doing the heavy lifting, preserved natural highlight detail on glossy surfaces - sauces, glazes, anything reflective - and used precise secondaries on individual ingredients so texture and freshness read clearly. The goal was food that looks like you'd actually eat it, not food that looks like it's been lit for a catalogue.",
  "motorone": "Automotive surface protection - the product is invisible, so the grade has to sell what it does to the car. I shaped contrast to emphasise reflections and panel lines, protected highlight structure on metallic paint where blow-out would kill the effect, and used local windows to steer attention. The overall look needed to be technical and high-performance without tipping into cold or clinical.",
  "denton-pillows": "Comfort branding where everything needs to feel soft without looking flat. I used a low-stress contrast profile with gentle glow control in the highlights - just enough halation-style warmth to sell the mood - and kept skin in a warm-neutral range that felt calm rather than graded. Fabric detail and product clarity still had to hold up, which is the tension in any lifestyle grade: make it feel effortless while making sure everything reads.",
  "cowra": "Tourism content across multiple locations that all needed to feel like the same trip. Bright, inviting, naturally cinematic - but the real challenge was cohesion. Sky and landscape exposure got managed through highlight recovery and selective tonal mapping, and I tuned greens and earth tones so a vineyard, a main street, and a river valley all sat comfortably in the same visual world.",
  "rumbalara": "Warmth, intimacy, and emotional continuity across dialogue scenes and lifestyle footage that were shot in very different conditions. Controlled shadow lift kept everything readable without flattening the mood, subtle midtone warmth tied the palette together, and careful shot normalisation made sure skin, interiors, and practical light sources all felt like they belonged in the same story.",
  "irwin-fran": "Documentary-style with a mix of archival and contemporary material - two different eras of footage that need to coexist without the joins showing. I prioritised natural skin texture and minimised intrusive colour shifts between sources, using gentle contrast shaping to preserve realism. The grade had to feel refined enough to sit on a broadcast platform while keeping the authenticity that makes documentary work connect.",
  "dora-the-explorer": "Day-for-night conversion in studio - designed to read as a believable night interior while still keeping the product inviting for a young audience. That's a specific balancing act: lower the overall exposure, cool the ambient channels, but don't lose the warmth in skin or make anything feel threatening. I used selective contrast shaping, window control on practical light sources, and careful density management so the scene had depth and legibility without ever feeling dark for the sake of it.",
  "a-gentle-giant": "Cinematic contrast with motivational intent and strong subject focus. I used selective exposure to guide attention to the hero subject, built richer neutrals into the environment so the background supported rather than competed, and kept skin balanced consistently. The kind of grade where the emotion should feel like it comes from the story, not from the colour.",
  "football-christmas": "The director asked for a very specific mood: festive but subdued, with an intimate, cozy palette rather than bright holiday gloss. I built that through controlled warmth, softer contrast shaping, and restrained saturation so the atmosphere stayed moody without feeling dull. Across multiple setups and fast edits, I stabilised whites, practical sources, and skin consistency so the tone remained unified from shot to shot.",
  "show-dont-tell": "Pragmatic toughness and product confidence. The grade leaned into bold contrast with controlled highlight clipping on tool surfaces - letting the hard light do its job without losing detail - and selective colour weighting in brand hues. Impactful but technically clean. No room for ambiguity about what the product is or what it's built for.",
  "ginfusion": "Premium beverage work where the glass is doing half the storytelling. Warm highlights for liquid glow, careful label readability so the branding doesn't disappear into the backlight, and fine secondary isolation to keep bottle, garnish, and environment feeling cohesive. The lusciousness has to feel real - condensation, refraction, the way light moves through liquid - not composited.",
  "2xu": "Performance activewear with dynamic camera movement and a lot of motion in every frame. The grade needed to be crisp and athletic - tighter contrast, controlled cyan and blue channels in the fabric, and robust exposure normalisation so energy stayed consistent through sequences that were never shot to match. The product has to separate clearly from the body and the background, even mid-movement.",
  "find-your-place": "Aspirational community content with ensemble subjects and outdoor daylight that changed between takes. Tonal harmonisation across the outdoor footage was the foundation, then selective enhancement of key team colours and consistent skin balancing so every subject carried equal visual weight. Story clarity in a spot like this depends on the viewer reading the group as cohesive, and that's a grading problem as much as a casting one.",
  "drive": "Modern automotive atmosphere with clean commercial polish. Shadow detail preserved, contrast depth built progressively rather than crushed in, and mixed-light contamination managed in practical environments where the car was picking up every colour in the room. Selective windows reinforced narrative focus points - steering the eye is part of the grade, not an afterthought.",
  "jetstar-airport-services": "Recruitment content shot across multiple terminal locations under fluorescent and mixed operational lighting - the least flattering conditions possible for making people look trustworthy and approachable. A key stylistic choice was to transition many shots into tasteful black and white while preserving Jetstar's bright red star as a controlled color accent, giving the piece a sharper visual identity without feeling forced. I kept the grade neutral-clean where needed, managed the green-cast problem airport lighting tends to introduce, and ensured faces and uniforms remained consistent across locations.",
  "ecco-safety": "Industrial product communication where the hero item literally emits light. The contrast structure had to preserve beacon intensity without blooming or losing the environment around it, brand colours needed to stay locked across demonstrations, and shot matching kept technical sequences visually reliable. Functional content, but functional content still needs to look like someone cared.",
  "doodle-bears": "Playful, saturated, and aimed at a young audience - but fabric texture and packaging detail still needed to hold up. I applied selective chroma boosts in hero colours without blowing out the highlights on bright sets, maintained gentle skin handling, and kept everything clean and readable. Kids' content doesn't mean the craft standards drop. If anything, the simplicity makes sloppy work more obvious.",
  "rasta-man-vibration": "Stylised cinematic finish with a human centre. Deeper tonal separation and warm-cool contrast interplay gave the image its character, while subtle grain and texture management kept the mood without obscuring performance detail. The style had to feel authored - clearly a choice, not a preset - while still serving the people in the frame rather than competing with them.",
  "amp": "Architecture and property storytelling where precision matters more than atmosphere. Interior and exterior luminance needed balancing - particularly window highlights where the view is half the selling point - and neutral tones had to be tuned so materials, lines, and spatial scale read accurately. Premium property content fails the moment the marble looks like laminate or the proportions feel compressed.",
  "kakadu-complex": "Health product branding with food-adjacent colour that had to feel vibrant and natural without crossing into supplement-ad territory. Contrast shaped for clean packaging readability, yellow and green channels controlled carefully to avoid unwanted cast, and consistent tonality maintained across skin, product, and ingredients. Credibility was the brief - everything had to look like something you'd trust enough to actually use.",
  "expo-2020-story": "Expo 2020 Story had to hold as a narrative piece while moving through dense strategic content and fast visual transitions. I built a motion-language pass around timing consistency, typographic contrast, and controlled chroma so key messages stayed legible on large-format displays without flattening the cinematic intent. The finish focused on rhythm and hierarchy: clean transitions, disciplined luminance management, and delivery-safe outputs across multiple venue playback constraints.",
  "expo-2020-iptm18": "For IPTM 2018, the requirement was executive-facing communication that still felt authored, not templated. I structured the visual system around robust title-safe composition, predictable pacing, and colour separation that kept maps, charts, and footage readable under projection conditions. The technical work was mostly about reliability under pressure: version control, consistency across language updates, and export discipline for event-scale playback.",
  "expo-2020-iptm19": "IPTM 2019 extended the same communication framework with tighter timelines and higher content turnover. I refined motion cadence, contrast handling, and scene transitions to keep long-form presentations clear across different screen environments and ambient light levels. The output strategy prioritised operational certainty: predictable renders, controlled asset naming, and playback-ready masters that reduced last-minute risk onsite.",
  "expo-2020-global-media-briefing": "Global Media Briefing content needed to read instantly for a mixed international audience while preserving institutional tone. I built a restrained visual hierarchy with strong typographic anchors, measured motion transitions, and selective colour weighting so data-heavy sections remained clear without visual fatigue. The finish balanced aesthetic polish with practical delivery reliability across broadcast captures, live projection, and distributed review copies.",
  "dubai-business-events": "Business Events Presentation work required editorial clarity first: dense information, short attention windows, and high scrutiny from senior stakeholders. I shaped the sequence using disciplined layout logic, conservative animation timing, and colour treatment that supported comprehension rather than decoration. The result was a presentation system that could absorb revisions quickly while keeping visual continuity intact.",
  "dubai-master-business-presentation": "Master Business Presentation was built as a high-stakes communication tool where structural clarity mattered more than visual effect. I focused on hierarchy, pacing, and contrast control so strategic points landed cleanly in-room and on recorded outputs. Behind the scenes, the key contribution was workflow resilience: reusable structures, organised asset pipelines, and dependable versioning through multiple approval rounds.",
  "uae-year-of-reading": "UAE Year of Reading combined cultural storytelling with institutional messaging, so the visual treatment had to feel warm, precise, and respectful. I used restrained palette shaping, balanced motion tempo, and selective emphasis to guide attention without overwhelming the narrative. Technical execution centered on consistency across multi-format deliverables, ensuring the campaign read cohesively from large displays to social cutdowns.",
  "gitex-vr": "Gitex VR needed to communicate immersive concepts while staying operationally robust for exhibition deployment. I structured the visual output around clarity in motion cues, legible UI moments, and controlled tonal range so content held up across varying screens and environmental lighting. The finishing pass emphasised system reliability: stable media packaging, predictable playback behaviour, and clean handoff for event teams.",
  "renault-zoe": "Renault Zoe Reveal demanded a modern automotive finish with sharp product readability and event-grade presentation energy. I shaped highlights and reflections to preserve body-line detail, stabilised colour balance across mixed lighting setups, and tuned motion pacing for reveal impact without visual clutter. The pipeline was designed for fast iteration and clean approvals, with delivery masters prepared for both live and digital channels.",
  "ikea": "IKEA Temporary Store content sat between brand storytelling and practical retail communication. I focused on clean spatial readability, controlled warmth in materials, and motion timing that supported wayfinding and product emphasis across busy visual layouts. The technical challenge was maintaining consistency across many assets and formats while keeping updates efficient during rollout.",
  "dubai-flea-market": "Dubai Flea Market required upbeat, accessible motion design that could carry event information without looking generic. I built the look around energetic but disciplined transitions, colour control for legibility, and clear typographic hierarchy across quick scene changes. Finishing priorities were throughput and consistency: repeatable templates, organised versioning, and exports tuned for both venue screens and online promotion.",
  "welcome-to-sharjah": "Welcome to Sharjah blended cultural imagery with destination messaging, so tonal decisions needed to support both atmosphere and clarity. I balanced warm-cool relationships, refined shot matching across varied capture conditions, and used measured motion graphics to guide narrative flow. Output preparation focused on dependable cross-platform behaviour, from large-format playback to compressed distribution deliverables.",
  "mrajeeb-al-fhood": "Mrajeeb Al Fhood combined documentary-style material with formal communication requirements. I shaped the grade toward natural skin and environmental credibility while preserving enough contrast structure for projection and digital display contexts. The broader contribution was workflow architecture: organised media handling, revision-safe timelines, and consistent final renders across language and format variants.",
  "merrie-melodies": "Merrie Melodies called for playful pacing and expressive colour without sacrificing technical cleanliness. I used targeted saturation control, contrast shaping, and rhythmic animation transitions to keep the piece energetic while preserving readability in every frame. The final delivery set was engineered for consistency across display environments, with reliable version management through late-stage changes.",
  "dms17-cadillac": "The Cadillac sequence for Dubai Motor Show needed premium presence with tight control over metallic highlights and showroom contrast. I built the finish around reflection management, deeper neutral separation, and precise motion pacing so product form stayed authoritative on large exhibition screens. Delivery strategy prioritized predictable playback and clean mastering under event deadlines.",
  "dms17-gmc": "The GMC segment required a bolder visual stance while maintaining brand consistency across shared campaign infrastructure. I tuned luminance density, maintained texture in bright specular areas, and aligned transition timing so the narrative felt deliberate rather than overstimulated. On the technical side, I maintained strict asset discipline and render consistency for multi-screen event deployment.",
  "fashion-photography": "Ana Juarez Workshop imagery needed editorial polish while preserving texture, garment fidelity, and believable skin tone under mixed lighting. I approached the series with controlled contrast shaping, selective colour refinement in wardrobe channels, and careful highlight roll-off to keep the work sophisticated without looking over-processed. The finishing pipeline prioritised consistency across the full set so every frame sat in the same visual language.",
  "audi-untaggable": "Audi #Untaggable was built around high-contrast visual storytelling where vehicle surfaces and environment reflections carried much of the narrative. I shaped tonal depth to preserve panel detail, kept neutral balance stable under changing conditions, and used restrained colour separation so brand cues remained clear without artificial intensity. The set was finished for cross-channel flexibility, from campaign stills to digital adaptations.",
  "cornello": "Cornello dei Tasso required photographic treatment that respected material texture and place-specific atmosphere rather than forcing a stylised look. I balanced natural luminance with subtle local contrast, protected highlight detail in stone and foliage, and refined colour relationships to keep the series coherent across varied weather and time-of-day captures. The final output aimed for understated precision and repeatable quality.",
  "patterns": "Patterns is a detail-led photographic body of work where structure, rhythm, and micro-contrast are central to image impact. I focused on tonal discipline, edge clarity, and colour neutrality so each composition retained depth without visual noise. The finishing pass kept a consistent calibration across the series, ensuring the work translates cleanly between web presentation and print-oriented outputs.",
  "la-grande-bellezza": "La Grande Bellezza was graded as an editorial photographic series with emphasis on mood continuity and refined tonal architecture.
