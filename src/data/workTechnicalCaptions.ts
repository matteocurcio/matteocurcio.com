export const WORK_TECHNICAL_CAPTIONS: Record<string, string> = {
  "moveactive": "High-energy sport work where the footage is already doing a lot - fast movement, mixed lighting, skin under stress. The job was to push contrast and saturation hard enough to feel punchy without letting skin go plastic or highlights clip into noise. I built a contrast curve with controlled roll-off at the top end, drove brand-critical hues selectively, and ran tight shot-to-shot balancing so continuity held through setups that were never going to match on their own.",
  "yamaha": "Yamaha wanted premium without synthetic. That sounds simple until you're trying to keep product whites truly neutral while everything around them is reflecting colour. The grade sat on clean micro-contrast and disciplined skin isolation, with highlight management doing the heavy lifting to keep detail in chrome and bodywork. Local keys where needed, but the goal was a confident commercial finish that didn't look like it was trying too hard.",
  "victorian-queens": "Cinematic character work with mood shifts built into the narrative. Softer toe contrast gave the shadows room to breathe, and I used selective colour separation in wardrobe and practical lights to let each setup carry its own atmosphere without breaking the overall visual language. Shadow density was the constant negotiation - expressive enough to feel authored, controlled enough that faces stayed readable in every scene.",
  "tradie": "Rugged, no-nonsense campaign where the product had to read clearly through dust, movement, and rapid editorial cuts. I leaned into a robust contrast structure with warm highlight bias and kept saturation honest - grounded, not stylised. The real work was matching across cameras and exposure swings so the pace of the edit felt deliberate rather than chaotic.",
  "madebox": "The brief was warmth and authenticity - handmade feel, trust-led branding. I built the palette around natural skin and wood tones, pulled back digital harshness with gentle highlight compression, and ran subtle secondary corrections to keep product colours consistent between interior and exterior. The kind of grade that's doing a lot of work precisely because it doesn't look like it.",
  "national-hero": "Emotional storytelling with national identity running through the visuals. Clean skin rendering was non-negotiable, and I pushed into richer greens and golds where the imagery supported it without turning the whole thing into a flag. Controlled contrast expansion gave it cinematic weight while keeping luminance broadcast-safe through fast editorial transitions - which is where most grades like this start falling apart.",
  "be-on-it-ent": "Contemporary, socially native, but still premium. Three things that fight each other if you're not careful. The grade was contrast-forward with vibrant but controlled chroma - enough pop to hold attention on a phone, enough restraint to not look cheap on a bigger screen. Selective keys on faces and hero props, and tight shot matching so the pace could stay sharp without the visuals drifting between setups.",
  "spring-party": "Politix needed fashion-forward polish - glossy highlights, premium colour separation, and wardrobe tones that stayed elegant under mixed practical lighting. I built a contrast response with shine to it, protected skin neutrality where the lighting wanted to push it warm or cool, and used targeted hue shaping so fabric colours held their identity across the full campaign. Fashion work where the grade has to serve the clothes without forgetting there's a person wearing them.",
  "refreshed": "Clean grooming aesthetics where skin has to look healthy, not retouched. I balanced cooler environmental values against warmer skin channels to create separation without obvious manipulation, controlled specular peaks so the product read clearly, and used selective density to build depth in the frame. The texture had to feel tactile - close enough to touch - without any of the harsh clinical quality that grooming content defaults to.",
  "kikkoman": "Food work where the line between appetising and oversaturated is about two nodes on a curve. I kept warm midtones doing the heavy lifting, preserved natural highlight detail on glossy surfaces - sauces, glazes, anything reflective - and used precise secondaries on individual ingredients so texture and freshness read clearly. The goal was food that looks like you'd actually eat it, not food that looks like it's been lit for a catalogue.",
  "motorone": "Automotive surface protection - the product is invisible, so the grade has to sell what it does to the car. I shaped contrast to emphasise reflections and panel lines, protected highlight structure on metallic paint where blow-out would kill the effect, and used local windows to steer attention. The overall look needed to be technical and high-performance without tipping into cold or clinical.",
  "denton-pillows": "Comfort branding where everything needs to feel soft without looking flat. I used a low-stress contrast profile with gentle glow control in the highlights - just enough halation-style warmth to sell the mood - and kept skin in a warm-neutral range that felt calm rather than graded. Fabric detail and product clarity still had to hold up, which is the tension in any lifestyle grade: make it feel effortless while making sure everything reads.",
  "cowra": "Tourism content across multiple locations that all needed to feel like the same trip. Bright, inviting, naturally cinematic - but the real challenge was cohesion. Sky and landscape exposure got managed through highlight recovery and selective tonal mapping, and I tuned greens and earth tones so a vineyard, a main street, and a river valley all sat comfortably in the same visual world.",
  "rumbalara": "Warmth, intimacy, and emotional continuity across dialogue scenes and lifestyle footage that were shot in very different conditions. Controlled shadow lift kept everything readable without flattening the mood, subtle midtone warmth tied the palette together, and careful shot normalisation made sure skin, interiors, and practical light sources all felt like they belonged in the same story.",
  "irwin-fran": "Documentary-style with a mix of archival and contemporary material - two different eras of footage that need to coexist without the joins showing. I prioritised natural skin texture and minimised intrusive colour shifts between sources, using gentle contrast shaping to preserve realism. The grade had to feel refined enough to sit on a broadcast platform while keeping the authenticity that makes documentary work connect.",
  "dora-the-explorer": "Day-for-night conversion in studio - designed to read as a believable night interior while still keeping the product inviting for a young audience. That's a specific balancing act: lower the overall exposure, cool the ambient channels, but don't lose the warmth in skin or make anything feel threatening. I used selective contrast shaping, window control on practical light sources, and careful density management so the scene had depth and legibility without ever feeling dark for the sake of it.",
  "a-gentle-giant": "Cinematic contrast with motivational intent and strong subject focus. I used selective exposure to guide attention to the hero subject, built richer neutrals into the environment so the background supported rather than competed, and kept skin balanced consistently. The kind of grade where the emotion should feel like it comes from the story, not from the colour.",
  "football-christmas": "The director asked for a very specific mood: festive but subdued, with an intimate, cozy palette rather than bright holiday gloss. I built that through controlled warmth, softer contrast shaping, and restrained saturation so the atmosphere stayed moody without feeling dull. Across multiple setups and fast edits, I stabilised whites, practical sources, and skin consistency so the tone remained unified from shot to shot.",
  "show-dont-tell": "Pragmatic toughness and product confidence. The grade leaned into bold contrast with controlled highlight clipping on tool surfaces - letting the hard light do its job without losing detail - and selective colour weighting in brand hues. Impactful but technically clean. No room for ambiguity about what the product is or what it's built for.",
  "ginfusion": "Premium beverage work where the glass is doing half the storytelling. Warm highlights for liquid glow, careful label readability so the branding doesn't disappear into the backlight, and fine secondary isolation to keep bottle, garnish, and environment feeling cohesive. The lusciousness has to feel real - condensation, refraction, the way light moves through liquid - not composited.",
  "2xu": "Performance activewear with dynamic camera movement and a lot of motion in every frame. The grade needed to be crisp and athletic - tighter contrast, controlled cyan and blue channels in the fabric, and robust exposure normalisation so energy stayed consistent through sequences that were never shot to match. The product has to separate clearly from the body and the background, even mid-movement.",
  "find-your-place": "Aspirational community content with ensemble subjects and outdoor daylight that changed between takes. Tonal harmonisation across the outdoor footage was the foundation, then selective enhancement of key team colours and consistent skin balancing so every subject carried equal visual weight. Story clarity in a spot like this depends on the viewer reading the group as cohesive, and that's a grading problem as much as a casting one.",
  "drive": "Modern automotive atmosphere with clean commercial polish. Shadow detail preserved, contrast depth built progressively rather than crushed in, and mixed-light contamination managed in practical environments where the car was picking up every colour in the room. Selective windows reinforced narrative focus points - steering the eye is part of the grade, not an afterthought.",
  "jetstar-airport-services": "Recruitment content shot across multiple terminal locations under fluorescent and mixed operational lighting - the least flattering conditions possible for making people look trustworthy and approachable. A key stylistic choice was to transition many shots into tasteful black and white while preserving Jetstar's bright red star as a controlled color accent, giving the piece a sharper visual identity without feeling forced. I kept the grade neutral-clean where needed, managed the green-cast problem airport lighting tends to introduce, and ensured faces and uniforms remained consistent across locations.",
  "ecco-safety": "Industrial product communication where the hero item literally emits light. The contrast structure had to preserve beacon intensity without blooming or losing the environment around it, brand colours needed to stay locked across demonstrations, and shot matching kept technical sequences visually reliable. Functional content, but functional content still needs to look like someone cared.",
  "doodle-bears": "Playful, saturated, and aimed at a young audience - but fabric texture and packaging detail still needed to hold up. I applied selective chroma boosts in hero colours without blowing out the highlights on bright sets, maintained gentle skin handling, and kept everything clean and readable. Kids' content doesn't mean the craft standards drop. If anything, the simplicity makes sloppy work more obvious.",
  "rasta-man-vibration": "Stylised cinematic finish with a human centre. Deeper tonal separation and warm-cool contrast interplay gave the image its character, while subtle grain and texture management kept the mood without obscuring performance detail. The style had to feel authored - clearly a choice, not a preset - while still serving the people in the frame rather than competing with them.",
  "amp": "Architecture and property storytelling where precision matters more than atmosphere. Interior and exterior luminance needed balancing - particularly window highlights where the view is half the selling point - and neutral tones had to be tuned so materials, lines, and spatial scale read accurately. Premium property content fails the moment the marble looks like laminate or the proportions feel compressed.",
  "kakadu-complex": "Health product branding with food-adjacent colour that had to feel vibrant and natural without crossing into supplement-ad territory. Contrast shaped for clean packaging readability, yellow and green channels controlled carefully to avoid unwanted cast, and consistent tonality maintained across skin, product, and ingredients. Credibility was the brief - everything had to look like something you'd trust enough to actually use.",
  "expo-2020-story": "Narrative piece with a problem most showreels don't have: strategic content moving fast across screens built for spectacle, not nuance. I built the motion language around timing consistency and typographic contrast, then ran controlled chroma decisions so key messages stayed legible at exposition scale without flattening the cinematic intent. The real discipline was rhythm and hierarchy - clean transitions, luminance management that didn't fight the architecture, and delivery outputs that survived multiple venue playback chains without surprises.",
  "expo-2020-iptm18": "Executive-facing communication on a projection system that forgives nothing. Maps, charts, and mixed footage all have to read simultaneously, and the whole thing needs to look authored rather than assembled. I structured the visual system around title-safe composition, predictable pacing, and colour separation that held under real event conditions. The behind-the-scenes work was version control discipline and export reliability - the kind of invisible contribution that only becomes visible when it's missing.",
  "expo-2020-iptm19": "Same communication framework as the year before, tighter timelines, higher content turnover. The pressure point shifted from initial build to iteration speed. I refined motion cadence and contrast handling to keep long-form presentations coherent across different screen environments and ambient light levels. Output strategy was about operational certainty: predictable renders, controlled asset naming, playback-ready masters that reduced last-minute risk onsite.",
  "expo-2020-global-media-briefing": "Mixed international audience, institutional tone, data-heavy sections that had to read instantly without visual fatigue. That combination punishes anything decorative. I built a restrained visual hierarchy with strong typographic anchors, measured transitions, and selective colour weighting. The finish had to survive broadcast capture, live projection, and distributed review copies simultaneously - three different viewing conditions, one master.",
  "dubai-business-events": "Dense information, short attention windows, senior stakeholders. There is no room for pacing errors here. I shaped the sequence using disciplined layout logic, conservative animation timing, and colour treatment that supported comprehension rather than competed with it. The structural decision that mattered most was building a system that could absorb last-minute revisions without losing visual continuity - because there are always last-minute revisions.",
  "dubai-master-business-presentation": "High-stakes communication tool where structural clarity carries more weight than visual effect. The brief was not to impress - it was to land. I focused on hierarchy, pacing, and contrast so strategic points read cleanly both in-room and on recorded outputs. The workflow contribution was equally important: reusable structures, organised asset pipelines, and versioning that held up through multiple approval rounds without accumulating technical debt.",
  "uae-year-of-reading": "Cultural campaign photography where the brief carried real institutional weight - the images had to reflect a national initiative without feeling like official photography. The challenge was finding moments that felt genuine inside a structured event context, then making sure those moments communicated clearly at every scale the campaign needed, from exhibition panels to social formats. Warmth and authenticity were the brief; consistency and reach were the delivery problem.",
  "gitex-vr": "360-degree stereoscopic content for an exhibition environment is a specific brief: it needs to feel immersive enough to communicate the concept, and robust enough to run unattended across a full event day. The challenge with stereoscopic work at that scale is that anything slightly off - depth inconsistencies, poorly managed transitions, tonal shifts between eyes - becomes immediately uncomfortable to wear. I structured the piece so the spatial logic felt natural rather than demonstrative, with motion cues that guided rather than disoriented. The goal was a viewer who forgot they were evaluating technology and started experiencing it.",
  "renault-zoe": "Automotive reveal energy with product readability that actually has to hold. Sharp body-line detail, mixed lighting setups, an audience watching for the moment it lands. I shaped highlights and reflections to preserve form, stabilised colour balance across lighting changes, and tuned motion pacing for reveal impact without visual noise. Pipeline was built for fast iteration - clean approvals, delivery masters ready for both live event and digital channels.",
  "ikea": "Retail event photography where the product and the experience both need to read. Shoppers in frame, product on display, a space that was temporary but needed to feel considered. The job was to make a pop-up feel like a destination. That meant finding angles and moments that showed the space working - people engaging with it, not just standing in it - and editing toward energy and accessibility rather than catalogue precision.",
  "dubai-flea-market": "Recurring event marketing where the photography has to do two jobs simultaneously: capture the atmosphere of a specific market day, and build a visual identity that works across every future edition. The client needed images that felt alive and specific - real people, real energy - but that could also anchor consistent promotional material over time. The challenge was finding that balance on the floor of a busy market, working fast enough to catch the moments that make an event worth attending.",
  "welcome-to-sharjah": "The brief was destination and cultural storytelling - but in 360-degree stereoscopic, every frame is also a spatial claim. The viewer is placed inside the image, not in front of it, which changes everything about how atmosphere and depth need to be constructed. I worked to make the sense of place feel genuinely inhabited rather than staged for a camera rig. Shot selection, spatial composition, and the handling of depth across the stereo pair all had to reinforce the same emotional reading. The result needed to feel like an invitation, not a demonstration.",
  "mrajeeb-al-fhood": "Documentary material in 360-degree stereoscopic presents a particular tension: the form invites presence, but documentary integrity requires restraint. The client needed something that communicated the human reality of the subject without the immersive format overwhelming it. The work was in shaping footage that wasn't captured for stereo exhibition into something that held together spatially and emotionally. Matching across varied capture conditions, managing depth so it supported rather than distracted, and keeping the narrative legible inside a format where the viewer controls where they look.",
  "merrie-melodies": "The brief was expressive and playful, which sounds like permission to do anything until you realise that without discipline, energetic work just becomes noise. I focused on keeping the piece moving without losing readability in any frame - pacing, colour, and rhythm all working together so the result felt intentional rather than busy. The challenge was sustaining that energy across the full piece without it flattening out.",
  "dms17-cadillac": "Premium presence on a large exhibition screen is a specific problem. Metallic surfaces and showroom contrast do not behave the way they do in a controlled studio environment. I built the finish around reflection management, deeper neutral separation, and precise motion pacing so the product held its authority at scale. Delivery had to be predictable under event deadlines - no room for playback surprises.",
  "dms17-gmc": "Bolder visual stance than Cadillac, shared campaign infrastructure - which means brand consistency has to hold without both segments looking identical. I tuned luminance density, kept texture in bright specular areas, and aligned transition timing so the narrative felt deliberate. On the technical side, strict asset discipline and render consistency for multi-screen event deployment, where any deviation compounds.",
  "fashion-photography": "Fashion photography under mixed lighting with garment fidelity and skin tone accuracy both non-negotiable - the kind of brief where fixing one tends to break the other. The work was in finding a treatment that respected the designer's intent while holding together as a coherent series. Every frame needed to sit in the same visual language without looking like it had been forced there.",
  "audi-untaggable": "Automotive campaign where vehicle surfaces and environment reflections were doing the storytelling. The brief was high-contrast and visually driven, but brand clarity still had to hold through it. The challenge was keeping the images feeling authored rather than over-treated - confident tonal depth, accurate surface rendering, and enough restraint that the cars read as desirable rather than retouched.",
  "cornello": "Place-specific photography where the wrong visual approach would simply misrepresent the subject. A medieval hilltop village in Lombardy has its own light, texture, and atmosphere - the job was to record that faithfully, not to impose a look onto it. The work was in patience and precision: finding the light, protecting the texture, and building a series that holds together across varied conditions without any single image feeling like an outlier.",
  "patterns": "Detail-led work where the composition is already doing the heavy lifting. The photographic challenge is knowing when to stop - to let structure, rhythm, and micro-contrast carry the image without adding anything that competes with it. The series is about finding the geometry that already exists in everyday surfaces and making it visible. Restraint, precision, and a consistent eye across the set.",
  "la-grande-bellezza": "La Grande Bellezza was graded as an editorial photographic series with emphasis on mood continuity and refined tonal architecture. I built the look through controlled shadow density, selective warmth in midtones, and restrained saturation so the narrative atmosphere stayed elegant rather than theatrical. Consistency across the sequence was the priority, with each frame carrying its own character while remaining part of one authored set."
