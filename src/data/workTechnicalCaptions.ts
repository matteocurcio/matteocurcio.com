  "moveactive": "High-energy sport work where the footage is already doing a lot - fast movement, mixed lighting, skin under stress. The job was to push contrast and saturation hard enough to feel punchy without letting skin go plastic or highlights clip into noise. I built a contrast curve with controlled roll-off at the top end, drove brand-critical hues selectively, and ran tight shot-to-shot balancing so continuity held through setups that were never going to match on their own.",
  "yamaha": "Yamaha wanted premium without synthetic. That sounds simple until you're trying to keep product whites truly neutral while everything around them is reflecting colour. The grade sat on clean micro-contrast and disciplined skin isolation, with highlight management doing the heavy lifting to keep detail in chrome and bodywork. Local keys where needed, but the goal was a confident commercial finish that didn't look like it was trying too hard.",
  "victorian-queens": "Cinematic character work with mood shifts built into the narrative. Softer toe contrast gave the shadows room to breathe, and I used selective colour separation in wardrobe and practical lights to let each setup carry its own atmosphere without breaking the overall visual language. Shadow density was the constant negotiation - expressive enough to feel authored, controlled enough that faces stayed readable in every scene.",
  "tradie": "Rugged, no-nonsense campaign where the product had to read clearly through dust, movement, and rapid editorial cuts. I leaned into a robust contrast structure with warm highlight bias and kept saturation honest - grounded, not stylised. The real work was matching across cameras and exposure swings so the pace of the edit felt deliberate rather than chaotic.",
  "madebox": "The brief was warmth and authenticity - handmade feel, trust-led branding. I built the palette around natural skin and wood tones, pulled back digital harshness with gentle highlight compression, and ran subtle secondary corrections to keep product colours consistent between interior and exterior. The kind of grade that's doing a lot of work precisely because it doesn't look like it.",
  "national-hero": "Emotional storytelling with national identity running through the visuals. Clean skin rendering was non-negotiable, and I pushed into richer greens and golds where the imagery supported it without turning the whole thing into a flag. Controlled contrast expansion gave it cinematic weight while keeping luminance broadcast-safe through fast editorial transitions - which is where most grades like this start falling apart.",
  "be-on-it-ent": "Contemporary, socially native, but still premium. Three things that fight each other if you're not careful. The grade was contrast-forward with vibrant but controlled chroma - enough pop to hold attention on a phone, enough restraint to not look cheap on a bigger screen. Selective keys on faces and hero props, and tight shot matching so the pace could stay sharp without the visuals drifting between setups.",
  "spring-party": "Politix needed fashion-forward polish - glossy highlights, premium colour separation, and wardrobe tones that stayed elegant under mixed practical lighting. I built a contrast response with shine to it, protected skin neutrality where the lighting wanted to push it warm or cool, and used targeted hue shaping so fabric colours held their identity across the full campaign. Fashion work where the grade has to serve the clothes without forgetting there's a person wearing them.",
  "refreshed": "Clean grooming aesthetics where skin has to look healthy, not retouched. I balanced cooler environmental values against warmer skin channels to create separation without obvious manipulation, controlled specular peaks so the product read clearly, and used selective density to build depth in the frame. The texture had to feel tactile - close enough to touch - without any of the harsh clinical quality that grooming content defaults to.",
  "kikkoman": "Food work where the line between appetising and oversaturated is about two nodes on a curve. I kept warm midtones doing the heavy lifting, preserved natural highlight detail on glossy surfaces - sauces, glazes, anything reflective - and used precise secondaries on individual ingredients so texture and freshness read clearly. The goal was food that looks like you'd actually eat it, not food that looks like it's been lit for a catalogue.",
  "motorone": "Automotive surface protection - the product is invisible, so the grade has to sell what it does to the car. I shaped contrast to emphasise reflections and panel lines, protected highlight structure on metallic paint where blow-out would kill the effect, and used local windows to steer attention. The overall look needed to be technical and high-performance without tipping into cold or clinical.",
  "denton-pillows": "Comfort branding where everything needs to feel soft without looking flat. I used a low-stress contrast profile with gentle glow control in the highlights - just enough halation-style warmth to sell the mood - and kept skin in a warm-neutral range that felt calm rather than graded. Fabric detail and product clarity still had to hold up, which is the tension in any lifestyle grade: make it feel effortless while making sure everything reads.",
  "cowra": "Tourism content across multiple locations that all needed to feel like the same trip. Bright, inviting, naturally cinematic - but the real challenge was cohesion. Sky and landscape exposure got managed through highlight recovery and selective tonal mapping, and I tuned greens and earth tones so a vineyard, a main street, and a river valley all sat comfortably in the same visual world.",
  "rumbalara": "Warmth, intimacy, and emotional continuity across dialogue scenes and lifestyle footage that were shot in very different conditions. Controlled shadow lift kept everything readable without flattening the mood, subtle midtone warmth tied the palette together, and careful shot normalisation made sure skin, interiors, and practical light sources all felt like they belonged in the same story.",
  "irwin-fran": "Documentary-style with a mix of archival and contemporary material - two different eras of footage that need to coexist without the joins showing. I prioritised natural skin texture and minimised intrusive colour shifts between sources, using gentle contrast shaping to preserve realism. The grade had to feel refined enough to sit on a broadcast platform while keeping the authenticity that makes documentary work connect.",
  "dora-the-explorer": "Day-for-night conversion in studio - designed to read as a believable night interior while still keeping the product inviting for a young audience. That's a specific balancing act: lower the overall exposure, cool the ambient channels, but don't lose the warmth in skin or make anything feel threatening. I used selective contrast shaping, window control on practical light sources, and careful density management so the scene had depth and legibility without ever feeling dark for the sake of it.",
  "a-gentle-giant": "Cinematic contrast with motivational intent and strong subject focus. I used selective exposure to guide attention to the hero subject, built richer neutrals into the environment so the background supported rather than competed, and kept skin balanced consistently. The kind of grade where the emotion should feel like it comes from the story, not from the colour.",
  "football-christmas": "The director asked for a very specific mood: festive but subdued, with an intimate, cozy palette rather than bright holiday gloss. I built that through controlled warmth, softer contrast shaping, and restrained saturation so the atmosphere stayed moody without feeling dull. Across multiple setups and fast edits, I stabilised whites, practical sources, and skin consistency so the tone remained unified from shot to shot.",
  "show-dont-tell": "Pragmatic toughness and product confidence. The grade leaned into bold contrast with controlled highlight clipping on tool surfaces - letting the hard light do its job without losing detail - and selective colour weighting in brand hues. Impactful but technically clean. No room for ambiguity about what the product is or what it's built for.",
  "ginfusion": "Premium beverage work where the glass is doing half the storytelling. Warm highlights for liquid glow, careful label readability so the branding doesn't disappear into the backlight, and fine secondary isolation to keep bottle, garnish, and environment feeling cohesive. The lusciousness has to feel real - condensation, refraction, the way light moves through liquid - not composited.",
  "2xu": "Performance activewear with dynamic camera movement and a lot of motion in every frame. The grade needed to be crisp and athletic - tighter contrast, controlled cyan and blue channels in the fabric, and robust exposure normalisation so energy stayed consistent through sequences that were never shot to match. The product has to separate clearly from the body and the background, even mid-movement.",
  "find-your-place": "Aspirational community content with ensemble subjects and outdoor daylight that changed between takes. Tonal harmonisation across the outdoor footage was the foundation, then selective enhancement of key team colours and consistent skin balancing so every subject carried equal visual weight. Story clarity in a spot like this depends on the viewer reading the group as cohesive, and that's a grading problem as much as a casting one.",
  "drive": "Modern automotive atmosphere with clean commercial polish. Shadow detail preserved, contrast depth built progressively rather than crushed in, and mixed-light contamination managed in practical environments where the car was picking up every colour in the room. Selective windows reinforced narrative focus points - steering the eye is part of the grade, not an afterthought.",
  "jetstar-airport-services": "Recruitment content shot across multiple terminal locations under fluorescent and mixed operational lighting - the least flattering conditions possible for making people look trustworthy and approachable. A key stylistic choice was to transition many shots into tasteful black and white while preserving Jetstar's bright red star as a controlled color accent, giving the piece a sharper visual identity without feeling forced. I kept the grade neutral-clean where needed, managed the green-cast problem airport lighting tends to introduce, and ensured faces and uniforms remained consistent across locations.",
  "ecco-safety": "Industrial product communication where the hero item literally emits light. The contrast structure had to preserve beacon intensity without blooming or losing the environment around it, brand colours needed to stay locked across demonstrations, and shot matching kept technical sequences visually reliable. Functional content, but functional content still needs to look like someone cared.",
  "doodle-bears": "Playful, saturated, and aimed at a young audience - but fabric texture and packaging detail still needed to hold up. I applied selective chroma boosts in hero colours without blowing out the highlights on bright sets, maintained gentle skin handling, and kept everything clean and readable. Kids' content doesn't mean the craft standards drop. If anything, the simplicity makes sloppy work more obvious.",
  "rasta-man-vibration": "Stylised cinematic finish with a human centre. Deeper tonal separation and warm-cool contrast interplay gave the image its character, while subtle grain and texture management kept the mood without obscuring performance detail. The style had to feel authored - clearly a choice, not a preset - while still serving the people in the frame rather than competing with them.",
  "amp": "Architecture and property storytelling where precision matters more than atmosphere. Interior and exterior luminance needed balancing - particularly window highlights where the view is half the selling point - and neutral tones had to be tuned so materials, lines, and spatial scale read accurately. Premium property content fails the moment the marble looks like laminate or the proportions feel compressed.",
  "kakadu-complex": "Health product branding with food-adjacent colour that had to feel vibrant and natural without crossing into supplement-ad territory. Contrast shaped for clean packaging readability, yellow and green channels controlled carefully to avoid unwanted cast, and consistent tonality maintained across skin, product, and ingredients. Credibility was the brief - everything had to look like something you'd trust enough to actually use."
