  presentology: [
    "Most decks fall apart the moment someone other than the designer touches them. A layout that only works in the original presenter's hands isn't a template - it's a liability. I build presentation systems from narrative structure outward: what's the argument, what's the hierarchy, where does the audience need to breathe. Then I design the visual framework around that so anyone on the team can update a slide, swap a chart, or restructure a section without the whole thing collapsing. Clean master slides, locked type systems, logical naming. The kind of backstage discipline that means the person presenting can focus on the room instead of fighting the file."
  ],
  dataviz: [
    "A chart that needs a paragraph of explanation underneath it has failed at its job. Data visualization isn't about making numbers look interesting - it's about making them legible to someone who has thirty seconds and a decision to make. I work on chart logic, labelling hierarchy, and colour systems that hold up when the data changes, because the data always changes. Revision cycles are where most dashboards and reports start drifting - a quick fix here, a cramped label there - and suddenly nothing reads cleanly anymore. I build these things to survive updates, not just the first round of approval."
  ],
  ar: [
    "AR gets pitched as magic and delivered as a demo that works in one room under controlled lighting. The gap between concept and deployment is where most projects stall, and it's usually because nobody thought about tracking stability, asset optimisation, or device limitations until too late. I develop AR concepts with production constraints baked in from the start. Interaction design, performance budgets, environmental variables - all of it gets addressed early so the experience actually functions when real people use it in real spaces, not just when someone's holding an iPad at the perfect angle in a boardroom."
  ],
  immersive: [
    "Immersive formats break most of the rules you rely on in conventional production. You can't control where the viewer looks, cuts behave differently, and spatial continuity matters in ways that flat screens forgive. I plan capture, stitching, and finishing with the playback environment in mind from the beginning - whether that's a headset, a dome, a large-format installation, or a controlled venue screening. The story still needs to land emotionally and the image still needs to hold up technically, even when the format is doing something the audience hasn't seen before."
  ],
  mapping: [
    "The impressive part of projection mapping is easy to sell. The hard part is making it run reliably on the night. Content and architecture have to behave as a single system - geometry alignment, timing, blending, playback redundancy - and all of it needs to hold together under live conditions where you don't get a second take. I design with that pressure in mind. Bold creative is fine, encouraged even, but it has to be backed by technical execution that doesn't rely on luck or a perfect environment to function."
  ],
  finishing: [
    "Finishing is the stage where a project either lands cleanly or dies in a spreadsheet of revision notes. It's look continuity across deliverables, version control that actually protects the work, and delivery specs that match what the platform or broadcaster actually requires - not what someone assumed three weeks ago. I focus on keeping the path from final edit to sign-off as short and frictionless as possible. Aesthetic decisions get balanced against compliance requirements and schedule reality, because a beautiful grade means nothing if it's rejected on ingest."
  ],
  "beauty-retouch": [
    "Good retouching is invisible. The moment skin looks plastic or lighting looks manufactured, you've lost the viewer's trust and probably the brand's credibility along with it. I work to preserve texture, tone, and the natural behaviour of light on skin while meeting the brand's visual expectations. Standards get defined upfront - what gets cleaned, what stays, how far is too far - so hero images and cutdowns stay consistent across formats and revision rounds without someone having to re-litigate the approach every time a new crop comes through."
  ],
  advertising: [
    "Ad work moves fast, changes direction often, and involves a lot of people with strong opinions and tight deadlines. The craft challenge isn't doing the work - it's protecting visual consistency while translating rounds of feedback into practical post decisions without the timeline blowing out. I focus on controlled adaptation: knowing what can flex and what can't, keeping versioning clean, and making sure the fifteenth revision still looks like it belongs to the same campaign as the first. Reactive panic is not a post-production methodology."
  ],
  sport: [
    "Sport content lives and dies on energy, but energy without control just looks like a mess. Fast cuts, high contrast, saturated colour - it all works until it doesn't, and the line between dynamic and chaotic is thinner than most people think. I shape contrast, pacing, and colour continuity so the intensity reads clearly instead of overwhelming the viewer. The emotion is already in the footage. The job is to amplify it through discipline - knowing when to push and when to let the moment do the work on its own."
  ],
  realestate: [
    "Architecture deserves honest representation. Overcook the grade and the penthouse looks like a render. Underdo it and the agency gets calls about why the bathroom looks grey. I enhance mood and light while respecting the actual materials, structure, and mixed-lighting reality of built spaces. Deliverables are standardised across hero stills, walkthrough video, portal uploads, and print - so developers and agencies get dependable, consistent output regardless of which platform it ends up on. No surprises at the printer."
  ],
  fashion: [
    "Fashion work is a conversation between stylisation and product truth. Push the grade too far and the fabric doesn't read correctly - that silk looks like satin, that navy reads black. Pull back too much and the brand identity disappears. I work in the space between those two problems: controlling colour language and texture behaviour so skin tones stay credible, fabrics stay recognisable, and the overall image still carries the visual identity the brand is after. Consistency across a full campaign matters more than any single hero shot."
  ],
  food: [
    "Food that looks too perfect stops looking edible. There's a point where saturation tips from appetising into artificial, where highlights blow out and texture flattens, and the whole image starts feeling like a stock photo instead of something you'd actually want to eat. I manage highlight behaviour, texture separation, and brand colour accuracy so close-ups stay believable across packaging, digital, social, and print. The brief is usually simple - make it look good - but the execution requires more restraint than most people expect."
  ],
  "video-games-advertising": [
    "Game advertising is a production collision: gameplay capture, pre-rendered cinematics, UI elements, graphic overlays, and legal supers, all fighting for space in a thirty-second spot. The challenge is establishing a coherent visual language early enough that it survives the iteration cycles - because there will be many, and they'll come fast. I manage that process so speed doesn't erode clarity. Every version should still feel like it belongs to the same campaign, whether it's the hero trailer or the sixth platform-specific cutdown."
  ],
  "in-store": [
    "Retail environments don't care about your carefully calibrated monitor. Screens vary in brightness, colour, and mounting angle. Ambient light changes by the hour. Shoppers walk past in seconds. I design motion content and visual hierarchy for those actual conditions - not for a proof-of-concept viewed on a laptop in a meeting room. Messaging needs to land quickly, remain legible at a glance, and hold up across the unpredictable range of hardware and lighting that real retail spaces throw at you."
  ],
  corporate: [
    "Corporate content gets a bad reputation because most of it prioritises looking polished over actually communicating anything. I focus on structure, message clarity, and brand cohesion so internal comms, investor updates, and external messaging feel credible without tipping into the kind of over-produced corporate gloss that makes everyone in the room quietly disengage. Restraint is the skill here. Say what needs saying, make it look professional, and get out."
  ],
  "online-editing": [
    "Online is where you find out whether the offline was disciplined or not. Clean conforms, proper timeline hygiene, locked version control, correct delivery specs - this is the stage where shortcuts from earlier in the pipeline come back to bite. I treat online as a quality control environment as much as a finishing one. The aim is confidence in delivery: knowing that what leaves the suite matches what was approved, plays correctly on the target platform, and doesn't generate a panicked email at 11pm because something was missed."
  ],
  sync: [
    "Music placement is a timing and licensing discipline as much as a creative one. The wrong track at the right moment still doesn't work, and the right track with unclear rights is a problem waiting to surface. I curate music selections carefully against picture edit rhythm and narrative intention, then manage licensing clearance and delivery requirements across versions. The goal is a placement that feels inevitable - like the track was always meant to be there - while making sure the paperwork behind it is just as clean."
  ],
  royaltyfree: [
    "Utility music doesn't have to sound like utility music. Most royalty-free libraries are full of tracks that technically fit a brief but sound like they were assembled from the same sample pack as everything else. I produce tracks with consistent production standards and clear stylistic identity - pieces that integrate easily into commercial projects, clear licensing without friction, and still have enough character that they don't disappear into the background. Functional and distinctive aren't mutually exclusive."
  ],
  music: [
    "With Musetta, everything starts from emotion.",
    "Before arrangement, before sound design, before production polish, we ask what the picture actually needs to feel. From there, we work backwards into structure, instrumentation, and sonic space. Composition and mix are never separate stages for us. They are one continuous process. The way something is arranged shapes how it will sit in the mix, and the realities of the mix inform how we arrange. We build both together so the final result feels intentional rather than corrected.",
    "Musetta was formed around a shared interest in cinematic storytelling through sound. Over the years, our music has travelled across film, television, and advertising, and has been recognised internationally - including award nominations and wins in independent film circuits. Those moments matter to us, but more as confirmation that clarity and emotional honesty resonate, not as an endpoint.",
    "Our style sits somewhere between atmospheric minimalism and melodic cinematic writing. We are drawn to space, texture, and restraint. We prefer tension that breathes rather than overwhelms. Even when arrangements expand, they do so with purpose. Nothing ornamental for its own sake.",
    "What matters most is integration. The music must sit inside the film, not on top of it. It must serve narrative, rhythm, and pacing. If we have done our job properly, the piece arrives production-ready, integrates cleanly with picture, and does not require endless rounds of revision because it was composed before the brief was fully understood.",
    "We are not interested in loudness for attention. We are interested in alignment.",
    "That has always been the core of Musetta."
