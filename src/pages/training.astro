  <h1>1:1 tutoring for editors and colorists (DaVinci Resolve focused).</h1>

  <div class="two-col section">
    <div class="prose">
      <p>
        I tutor practical workflows: organizing projects, editing faster, building clean timelines, color pipeline
        fundamentals, and finishing for delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical sessions are structured around your real footage and goals. You leave with a repeatable setup, not
        generic tips.
      </p>

      <h2>Topics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Resolve editing and timeline discipline</li>
        <li>Color: primaries, secondaries, matching, look building</li>
        <li>Deliverables: web, broadcast, versioning and QC</li>
        <li>Workflow: storage, proxies, collaboration, backups</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Future booking</h2>
      <p>
        In a future iteration, this page can include accounts (user id + password) and a booking calendar showing live
        availability. For now, inquiries go through the contact page.
